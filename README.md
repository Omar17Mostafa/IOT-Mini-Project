# üöÄ SectorB5 IoT Project

**Mentored by:** Omar Barakat

## üìñ Project Overview

This mini IoT project demonstrates **two-way real-time communication** between hardware and a mobile app using the **MQTT protocol** and the **PubSubClient** library on an **ESP32 microcontroller**.

The system allows:
- A **virtual switch** in the mobile app (publisher) to control a **hardware LED** (subscriber).
- A **physical switch** (publisher) to control a **virtual LED** in the mobile app (subscriber), and simultaneously light up a second hardware LED on as visual feedback.

This project reflects a typical **Internet of Things (IoT)** use case with remote device control, state synchronization, and cloud-based messaging using **MQTT** ‚Äî a lightweight and efficient protocol ideal for real-time systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Wiring

| Component               | ESP32 Pin |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| App-Controlled LED      | GPIO14    |
| Button Feedback LED     | GPIO23    |
| Button (with pull-up)   | GPIO0     |
| GND (LED cathodes)      | GND       |
| VCC (3.3V for pull-up)  | 3.3V      |

- The button is connected with a **pull-up resistor** to 3.3V.
- When the button is **pressed**, it pulls GPIO0 **LOW** (active-low logic).
- The feedback LED on GPIO23 gives **local confirmation** of the button press.

## üõ∞Ô∏è MQTT Topics

| Topic                | Direction       | Description                               |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `esp32/ledControl`   | App ‚Üí ESP32      | Turns ON/OFF the LED on GPIO14            |
| `esp32/buttonStatus` | ESP32 ‚Üí App      | Updates the app LED based on button state |

### üîÑ Message Flow

- **Publisher (App)** *(QoS 0)* sends `1` or `0` to `esp32/ledControl`
- **Subscriber (ESP32)** *(QoS 0)* listens and controls LED
- **Publisher (ESP32)** *(QoS 0)* sends `1` or `0` to `esp32/buttonStatus`
- **Subscriber (App)** *(QoS 0)* listens and updates virtual LED
- **Feedback LED** on GPIO23 is also toggled as local confirmation between the physical push button and the app LED

## üîß How MQTT Works Internally

MQTT (IOT Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight **publish/subscribe** protocol where devices communicate **through a central MQTT broker**. Here's how your project uses it:

1. **App as Publisher:**
   - The switch widget in the **IoT MQTT Panel** sends a message (`"1"` or `"0"`) to topic `esp32/ledControl`.
   - This message goes through the **MQTT broker** (like `broker.emqx.io`).

2. **ESP32 as Subscriber:**
   - ESP32 is subscribed to `esp32/ledControl`.
   - Once the broker receives the message, it **immediately pushes** it to all subscribers.
   - ESP32 receives the message, and sets GPIO14 HIGH or LOW to turn the LED ON/OFF.

3. **ESP32 as Publisher:**
   - When the physical button is pressed (GPIO0 pulled LOW), ESP32 publishes `"1"` to `esp32/buttonStatus`.
   - This message is sent to the broker.

4. **App as Subscriber:**
   - The LED widget in the app is subscribed to `esp32/buttonStatus`.
   - As soon as the broker receives the update, it forwards it to the app.
   - The app LED changes accordingly.

> üß† The broker ensures **decoupled communication**: the publisher and subscriber don't need to know about each other ‚Äî only the topic matters.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Mobile ‚Üí ESP32 (LED Control):**
   - App sends `1` or `0` to `esp32/ledControl`.
   - ESP32 reads it and controls GPIO14 (main LED).

2. **ESP32 ‚Üí Mobile (Button Feedback):**
   - When the button on GPIO0 is pressed (goes LOW), ESP32:
     - Sends `1` to `esp32/buttonStatus`
     - Turns ON the feedback LED on GPIO23
   - When released, sends `0` and turns feedback LED OFF.
   - App LED updates based on this.

## üì± Mobile App Setup (IoT MQTT Panel)

1. **Install App:**  
   - Android: [IoT MQTT Panel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=snr.lab.iotmqttpanel)

2. **Create MQTT Broker Profile:**
   - Broker: `broker.emqx.io`
   - Port: `1883`
   - Client ID: anything unique (`omarmmomarom`)

3. **Add Widgets:**

| Widget Type | Topic                | Payload ON | Payload OFF |
|-------------|----------------------|------------|-------------|
| Switch      | `/OPERA/omar/led`   | `on`        | `off`         |
| LED         | `/sectorb5/omar/led` | `on`        | `off`         |

## üí° Real-World Applications

This model is the foundation of many smart systems:

- **Smart Homes**  
  Remote light/appliance control + physical switch feedback

- **Industrial Automation**  
  Operator actions on site reflected in control centers, and vice versa

- **Security Systems**  
  Alarms or door sensors publish events; security apps subscribe

- **Healthcare**  
  Emergency buttons for patients with immediate app alert for staff

- **Remote Monitoring**  
  Any kind of switch or sensor input published to cloud dashboards
